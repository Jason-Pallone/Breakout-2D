# Breakout-2D

This is the game breakout in 2D created using JavaScript and HTML canvas. Use the ball and paddle to break the bricks! Each brick you break gives you 1 point towards your overall score. Break all the bricks to win the game! The game keeps track of player lives and the current score. There is a message for when you win the game or if you lose.
